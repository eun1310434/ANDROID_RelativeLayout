Relative Layout
-----------
RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions.
The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements
(such as to the left-of or below another view) or
in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area
(such as aligned to the bottom, left or center).
